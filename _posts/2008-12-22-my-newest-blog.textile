Well, I'm at it again - creating a new blog. I think my blog:posts ratio is close enough to 1:1 that the actual variance is negligible. It's shocking really. My last blog contained exactly 1 post, as did the one before it, etc. Plus to offset the few blogs that have contained multiple posts, I've created a few blogs that never even got their first post. For shame!

Anyway, this is a shameless rip-off of "Mojombo's blog":http://mojombo.github.com, which he has happily invited us all to rip-off. I'm initially just interested in seeing my own name in Shiny letters on my GitHub page. I have high hopes of - in time - making this my own little creation. We'll see I suppose.
