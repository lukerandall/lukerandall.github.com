p(meta). 28 Nov 2010 - Cape Town

Lately I've been trying to learn a lot of new (at least for me) technologies and languages, and I've wanted a place to keep track of my thoughts and progress. So I've decided it makes sense for my to dust off the cobwebs and see if I can try make blogging stick. Time will tell.

h2. What's new?

I've changed things up a bit. Mostly by swapping out my dull sans serif font stack for Skolar. TypeKit is great, and I'm glad to finally have a site where I can use it.

I've swapped out the most of the blue in the old style for red. It's a work in progress, but I think it's an improvement.

h2. What I'll be writing about

Lately I've finally taken it upon myself to improve my JavaScript. I'll be doing some pretty interesting things in the coming months.

I'm also taking the time to learn more about functional programming, and in particular Haskell, so I'll probably have some very rudimentary posts about Haskell from time to time.
