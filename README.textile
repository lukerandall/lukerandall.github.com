h1. My blog

This is my latest attempt at keeping a blog. I've shamelessly ripped the layout and style from "http://github.com/mojombo/mojombo.github.com":http://github.com/mojombo/mojombo.github.com

It is automatically transformed by "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll into a static site whenever I push the repository to GitHub.
